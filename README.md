👋 Hi, I’m @sergiopdev1981  
👀 I’m interested in learning and building with Go, Python, and modern backend technologies.  
💼 I currently work with Go and have experience with Docker, PostgreSQL, and NATS.  
🌱 I’m planning to start learning Python for backend development and RESTful APIs.  
🌏 I’m also studying Chinese (Mandarin) as a personal challenge.  
🥁 I’m a musician, Ramones fanatic but I also listen to Blackpink.  
💞️ I’m open to collaborate on projects related to backend, APIs, DevOps, and cloud.  
📫 How to reach me: email... or an issue :)
